## Syllabus

### Course summary
This course is intended to teach students data analysis techniques used in conducting research in physics. We will be analyzing a mix of simulated and real data from particle physics and astrophysics experiments to get hands-on experience with looking at data. 

The course will be taught using [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) with python, although coding experience is not required. Topics will include visualizing data, understanding and estimating errors, basic fitting concepts, and evaluating hypotheses about data in a statistical manner. 

### Logistical information and Prerequisites

Course website: 

The course will meet for 80 minutes every week. There are two sections - students should attend the same section every week. Each class will have a brief introduction of important concepts, and the majority of the class time will be devoted to working through problems in small groups of 2-3 people. 

Because this course extensively uses python-based notebooks, students need to have access to a laptop. Laptops are available for check out through [Stanford Learning Technologies and Spaces](https://thehub.stanford.edu/services/computers-software-equipment/borrow-equipment).

Students should be familiar with calculus concepts such as differentiation, integration, and Taylor series.

Students are encouraged to attend the instructors' office hours to ask questions about the lab report or concepts covered in lab. We also like talking about physics and data! 

### Course Expectations and Grading
This is a 1-unit course. It is graded Satisfactory/No Credit. The class should take about 3 hours per week of your time. This includes:
- 80 minutes in class per week
- About 1.5 hours on lab reports outside of class

To receive credit, attendance and participation in each week's lab is expected. This includes arriving on time to class to participate in group work. Please speak to the instructor in advance if you have to miss a lab and we will schedule a session where you can make up the lab. 

For each lab, there will be a report assigned. Each report will be graded out of 3, where 1 is unsatisfactory, 2 indicates that you were missing some concepts, and 3 indicates that you understood most or all of the material. A grade of 2 or higher for each lab report is required. Reports which receive a grade of 1 can be resubmitted for a regrade. Each report is due one week after the lab and should be submitted on the Canvas website.

The last two weeks of the course are set aside to work on a final project using the concepts you have learned. Each student must complete a final project to receive credit. 

There is no required textbook for this course.

### Homework policy
A one-week extension for one report will be accepted without any questions asked (just note it as such on the report). No other late reports will be accepted unless granted by an instructor or TA.

### Course schedule

| Week No. | Week | Topic |

### Honor code
The Stanford Honor code is found [here](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-guidance/honor-code). We expect that students abide by the honor code.

Much like conducting scientific research, participating in the data labs in this course is very collaborative. Students will work in groups during class, and you are encouraged to talk to other students outside of class about lab concepts. We expect that the reports are in your own words and you credit others that you worked with, as well as any external resources. You can write this on the top of your reports in a line listing collaborators and resources used.

### Accommodations
#### Students with documented disabilities
From the [OAE website](https://oae.stanford.edu/students/accommodations-services/academic-accommodations): Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) and initiate their requests.  Because accommodations are not retroactive, students should contact the OAE as soon as possible in order to ensure timely notice and coordination.  Similarly, it is the student's responsibility to notify the OAE as early as possible in the event of any problems or unexpected barriers experienced in the obtaining of academic accommodations and services. 
#### Other accommodations
If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact the instructor.

### Classroom expectations
There will be a lot of discussion in this class. Students are expected to engage with others in a respectful manner. This includes thoughtfully sharing their ideas, but also listening to others' contributions. It is our highest priority that the classroom is a welcoming place to engage in academic discussions. Please read through this list of [guidelines](social.html).
