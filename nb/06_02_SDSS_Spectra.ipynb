The light from the fiber is then passed into a diffraction grating to seperate out the different wavelengths.

    "#### 7.1 What happened?  How would you interpret the fit result?  Do the parameters make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2 Try to guess about why we got this result.  What might have happened?  Don't worry if you aren't sure.  Just guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3 This illustrates that it is often important to start with a reasonable initial guess.  If we were fitting millions of spectra, we would want the program to make the initial guess instead of having to do it by hand.   How might you make an initial guess for the a) Line Peak, b) the Line Width, c) the Background at 500 nm, d) the Background slope?\n"
